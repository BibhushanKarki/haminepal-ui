                public crisis in Nepal through volunteer work and donations; our
                efforts and assistance were widely lauded during the crisis
                arising in the aftermath of the earthquake in 2015. On 25 April,
                2015 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 Richter scale struck
                Nepal along with continued aftershocks occurring throughout the
                nation at the intervals of 15â€“20 minutes. The earthquake
                affected a huge population of the nation with about 9,000
                fatalities and nearly 22,000 injured people.

              {/* <li><i className="bx bx-check-double"></i> Amid this humanitarian crisis, Hami Nepal members and volunteers worked tirelessly to set up the COVID ward in Bir Hospital and National Trauma Center. In order to further ramp up health infrastructure, we have converted unused government spaces into COVID facilities and provided support to 3 different government hospitals. Hami Nepal has successfully set up 170 beds in Bir Hospital and donated 50 beds to the new building of Bir Hospital. The team has also donated high function ICU beds, portable X-ray machines among other medical supplies and equipment using the collected donations.</li> */}

                portable high tech medical oxygen plant from the same donor. We
                have also deployed 100 beds and mattresses, 270 oxygen cylinders
                out of 520 and medical supplies to the Sudurpaschim Province of
                Nepal and other places. Our donors provided us with 50,000 N95
                Masks, 200 sets of PPE, 100 beds and other supplies which were
                then sent as aid to Sudurpaschim Province.
