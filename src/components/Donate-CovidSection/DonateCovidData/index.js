Nepal's already by a small health care system has been pushed to the brink and in consequence, the citizens are suffering. Authorities are struggling to provide emergency help to the rising number of infected citizens as the oxygen and bed shortages worsen by the hour. To alleviate the situation as best possible, a voluntary youth Group - Hami Nepali - has mobilized its volunteers to purchase and manage equipment and facilities in coordination with institutions, such as Bir Hospital, that are treating the COVID-19 patients, through collected donations. This GoFundMe page has been created to collect donations for the Hami Nepal group.",
