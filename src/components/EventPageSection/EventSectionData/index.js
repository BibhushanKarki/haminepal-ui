        paragraph: `Our team has already finalised to import an oxygen plant and we are conducting thorough research on which hospital will be hugely benefited with the provided oxygen plant. The research is conducted so that the Hami Nepal organisation could identify which hospital will make better use of the equipment without any profit-making. The oxygen plant will probably end the oxygen shortage in the hospital as the plant will provide enough oxygen for patients in the hospital having capacity of approx. 50 beds. Also, the oxygen plant has capacity to fill approx. 50 oxygen cylinders (7000 liter per cylinder) per day using a compressor. 
        These cylinders can be further sent to other people or hospitals that are in need of oxygen.

          "At the same time, we are collecting quality oxygen concentrators in order to build an oxygen concentrator bank which will directly benefit COVID-19 infected people. Since the lockdown has affected the already deprived COVID-19 patients who are not able to secure oxygen cylinder and refill it again, Hami Nepal will conduct a need-assessment so that we can verify the person is in serious need of oxygen concentrator and the equipment is not being misused.The people receiving the concentrators will also have to provide a photocopy of government issued Identity Card for proper tracking of equipment and to ensure the return-safety of equipment.By doing this, we believe that most of the COVID-19 infected people can be treated in their home and severe people will easily find beds in hospitals. Also, hospitals will not need to worry about lack of oxygen for patients preventing overload in hospitals.Till date, we have received a total of 18 oxygen concentrators which were all immediately deployed to those who are in serious need of the concentrators.",

        paragraph: `<p>The second wave was a sudden blow for Nepal as no preparation was made from the side of the government in case of another COVID-19 crisis.The lack of hospital beds, proper medical facility and critical oxygen supply took more lives than the virus itself. However, Hami Nepal team has personally learned from the second wave that we can’t just stay praying that no such thing happens again. Therefore, we are planning to expand outside the Kathmandu Valley with the intention to help as many people as we can without any expectation.</p>

          "On 25 April, 2015 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 Richter scale struck Nepal along with continued aftershocks occurring throughout the nation at the intervals of 15-20 minutes. The earthquake affected a huge population of the nation with about 9,000 fatalities and nearly 22,000 injured people.All of the hospitals in Kathmandu were in chaos and unmanaged with injured people flowing in rapidly. The National Trauma Center, a government hospital, was open but not on functionable state. Our organization founder, Mr. Sudan Gurung, who was not even from the social-work background, saw the miserable condition of the hospital and decided to help however he could. Nonetheless, the situation was much worse and one single person couldn’t make a whole hospital operational so he called out volunteers. After hearing about the condition of the hospital 200 volunteers showed up for help. The number grew from 200 to 300 reaching 1600 total. Together, the young army of volunteers first volunteered in order to help the hospital to run properly and then expanded out of Kathmandu Valley to provide relief in 48 different remote areas of Nepal beginning the third day of the 2015 earthquake.",
