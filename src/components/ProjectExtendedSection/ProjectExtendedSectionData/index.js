    position: `Since childhood, I have always known that when I would grow up I could make use of my natural ability to empathize with others and my strong desire 
    to help people ease their pain. This is why, since my highschool days I made the decision to start doing 
    social work and channel my energies and efforts into helping those less fortunate than me. So since then I
     have been helping people by grouping with my friends and making a plan and getting that into action like 
     raising funds for kidney patients and donating grocery items to an orphanage. And recently when I got to know about Hami Nepal Youth Organisation 
     and the works done by the team to help in covid crisis saving as many lives as they can not thinking about day or night I wanted to join the organisation so badly.
      I then joined the organisation after some time period. It has been a great feeling working with the team.I have gained much experience and knowledge about how to
       get things done. Talking about my experience, working with the Hami Nepal Team, we have been able to bring Chhetrapati Free Health Clinic into 
       work by managing ICU beds, ventilators and concentrators, opening Covid Ward and managing beds and ventilators in the new Bir Hospital Building. 
       I feel proud working with the team
