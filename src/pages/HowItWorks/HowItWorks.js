              Our main objective is to help anyone in need without any
              hesitations and expectation of payback. Hami Nepal directly
              connects donors and recipients to maintain transparency. The
              organisation doesnâ€™t spend any of the received donations on
              administration cost as we believe that 100% of the donation should
              reach the recipient in order to establish effective helping. All
              of our volunteers, mobilised for the authentication of the
              problem, logistics and delivery, cover their own expenses in order
              to save the administrative expense. We are implementing
              skill-based volunteering to facilitate healthcare services and
              mitigate the risk of this devastating COVID-19 cases surge, at the
              time being.
